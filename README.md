influxdb
========

Unofficial InfluxDB client written in Go to send stats and query the stored data.

> This client library has additional goodies that the official one does not have (like interacting
  with [golang.org/x/net/context](golang.org/x/net/context)) but it is incomplete; it only contains the functions we need
  for our applications.
